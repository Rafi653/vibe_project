## Overview

This PR has prepared everything you need to create the remaining 6 sub-issues (steps 5-10) for your Fitness Coaching App project. All templates and automation scripts are ready to use.

## What Was Created

✅ **6 Detailed Issue Templates** - Complete with tasks, acceptance criteria, and dependencies
✅ **2 Automation Scripts** - Bash and Python scripts for one-command issue creation
✅ **Comprehensive Documentation** - Multiple guides for different use cases
✅ **Updated README** - Project roadmap added with progress tracking

## Next Steps

### Step 1: Choose Your Method

Pick one of these three methods to create the issues:

#### **Method A: Automated with Bash (Fastest)** ⚡
```bash
cd .github
./create-sub-issues.sh
```

#### **Method B: Automated with Python** 🐍
```bash
cd .github
python3 create-sub-issues.py
```

#### **Method C: Manual Creation** ✍️
1. Open `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATES.md`
2. For each issue (7-12):
   - Go to: https://github.com/Rafi653/vibe_project/issues/new
   - Copy the title and body
   - Add label: "enhancement"
   - Click "Submit new issue"

### Step 2: Verify Issues Were Created

After running the automated script or creating manually:

1. Visit: https://github.com/Rafi653/vibe_project/issues
2. Verify you see 6 new issues (#7-#12)
3. Check that each has:
   - ✓ "enhancement" label
   - ✓ Clear tasks listed
   - ✓ Acceptance criteria
   - ✓ Dependencies noted

## Prerequisites for Automated Scripts

If using Method A or B, you need:

1. **GitHub CLI installed**
   ```bash
   # Check if installed
   gh --version
   
   # Install if needed (Ubuntu/Debian)
   curl -fsSL https://cli.github.com/packages/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg | sudo dd of=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg
   echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg] https://cli.github.com/packages stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/github-cli.list > /dev/null
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install gh
   ```

2. **Authentication**
   ```bash
   gh auth login
   ```
   
3. **Repository Access**
   - You must have write access to the repository

## Troubleshooting

### "Permission denied" error on script
```bash
chmod +x .github/create-sub-issues.sh
chmod +x .github/create-sub-issues.py
```

### "gh: command not found"
GitHub CLI is not installed. Use Method C (manual) or install gh CLI first.

### "gh: To use GitHub CLI in a GitHub Actions..."
You need to authenticate: `gh auth login`

### Script runs but issues aren't created
- Check your internet connection
- Verify you have write access to the repository
- Try running with verbose output
