- **Coach endpoints**: Require COACH or ADMIN role
- **Admin endpoints**: Require ADMIN role only

Users can only access their own data unless they have elevated permissions (coach/admin).

## Data Validation

Both frontend and backend implement comprehensive data validation:

- **Required fields** are enforced
- **Data types** are validated (numbers, dates, etc.)
- **Value ranges** are checked (e.g., non-negative values for weight, calories)
- **User permissions** are verified before any operation

## Testing

Comprehensive test suite covers:

- All client endpoints
- Authentication flows
- Data validation
- Error handling
- Role-based access control

Run tests with:
```bash
cd backend
pytest tests/ -v
```
