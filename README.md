   ```

2. Follow the setup instructions in [backend/README.md](backend/README.md)

Quick start:
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

## Team Onboarding
Welcome to the Vibe Project! This repository is structured to separate frontend and backend concerns clearly:
- `/backend` - All server-side code, APIs, database models, and business logic
- `/frontend` - All client-side code, UI components, and user-facing features

Stay tuned for more detailed setup instructions as we scaffold the project further.
