## Getting Started

### Quick Start with Docker (Recommended)

The easiest way to get started is using Docker:

```bash
# Start all services (PostgreSQL + Backend)
docker-compose up -d

# Run database migrations
docker-compose exec backend alembic upgrade head

# Seed the database with test data (optional)
docker-compose exec backend python -m app.db.seed

# Seed with comprehensive chart data (recommended for charts feature)
docker-compose exec backend python -m app.db.seed_charts
```

Access the application:
- **API**: http://localhost:8000
- **API Docs**: http://localhost:8000/api/docs
- **Health Check**: http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health

For detailed Docker setup instructions, see [DOCKER_SETUP.md](DOCKER_SETUP.md).

### Frontend Setup
The frontend is built with React.js and includes role-based navigation for clients, coaches, and administrators.

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

For more details, see the [Frontend README](frontend/README.md).

### Backend Setup (Without Docker)
The backend is built with Python and FastAPI. To get started:

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Follow the setup instructions in [backend/README.md](backend/README.md)

Quick start:
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up database (see backend/DATABASE_SETUP.md)
alembic upgrade head

# Run the application
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

The API will be available at http://localhost:8000 with interactive docs at http://localhost:8000/api/docs

## Team Onboarding
Welcome to the Vibe Project! This repository is structured to separate frontend and backend concerns clearly:
- `/backend` - All server-side code, APIs, database models, and business logic
- `/frontend` - All client-side code, UI components, and user-facing features

Stay tuned for more detailed setup instructions as we scaffold the project further.
