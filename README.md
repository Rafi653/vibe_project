   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Team Onboarding
Welcome to the Vibe Project! This repository is structured to separate frontend and backend concerns clearly:
- `/backend` - All server-side code, APIs, database models, and business logic
- `/frontend` - All client-side code, UI components, and user-facing features

Stay tuned for more detailed setup instructions as we scaffold the project further.
